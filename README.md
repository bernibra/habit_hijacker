# habit_hijacker

At the core of every habit lies a loop made of three parts: a cue, a routine, and a reward. To change or build a habit, the first step is to recognize and reflect on these components.

The cue is the trigger that prompts your behavior, often without conscious thought. The routine is the habit, whether helpful or harmful. And the reward is what your brain craves. This app attempts to support that reward, whether through the satisfaction of seeing your progress or a fun fact to entertain your mind.

Even if this app doesn’t change your habits overnight, let it be a tool to help you identify your cues, understand your routines, and capture your progress.
